The official OpenEmbedded/Yocto BSP layer for Entropic platforms.

#It is hosted on http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/meta-ti/ with the
#source repository at git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-ti


This layer depends on:

URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
layers: meta
branch: master


When not depending on meta-openembedded and not using systemd, you may need to
mask few miscellaneous recipes requiring systemd, by adding this to local.conf:

BBMASK = "meta-ti/recipes-misc"


The base BSP part of meta-ti should work with different OpenEmbedded/Yocto
distributions and layer stacks, such as:
distro-less (only with OE-Core), with Yocto/Poky, with Angstrom or Arago.

Please follow the recommended setup procedures of your OE distribution.
